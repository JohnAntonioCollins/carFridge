carfridge ui notes
a series of graphs, like a medical equipment display or an audio production software ui.
a line represents "now" and data passes behind it as it's generated.
can scroll or "scrub" backward and forward over historical data.
statistical "points of interest" are automatically highlited and foot-noted with an explanation like 
(highest ever temp, largest disparity between ambient and fridge, shortest cycle time of fridge, shutdown or restart times, etc)
some important stats are always shown at bottom or top of ui.
alerts when data is out of acceptable parameters.
@z maybe like dashboard gauges at top for "now", good params are where needles are pointed up for quick "ok" at a glance.
