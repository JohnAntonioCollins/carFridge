GOAL: restore car-fridge ras'pi on new sd card

TODO:
power supply; get truely adequate power supply. 12v-5v converter for sol'fridge, 110v-5v for bench, 2.5amp minimum constant.
graceful shutdown; build yes/no voltage sensor. code graceful shutdown on no-voltage. 
low-volt led; put a red LED on the normally closed side of the accessory relay to get a visual indicator of low voltage protection.
boot on yes-voltage; build a reverse yes/no voltage sensor with capacitor+resistor so it's momentary. connect to pins... 5 & 6? to short and bootup. 
	OR? change a setting before rebooting, go into lower power fridge monitor mode, then on yes-voltage change settings to normal and reboot.
