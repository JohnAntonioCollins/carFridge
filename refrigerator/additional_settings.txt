These special features are accessed by first turning off the cooler with the "ON/OFF" button. Then pressing and holding "Set" until "E1" appears. Press "Set" to move to each setting in turn, and press the up/down buttons to make adjustments. The special settings are:
"E1" Lowest temperature setting
"E2" Highest Temperature setting (I think there is a maximum 40 C spread between E1 and E2)
"E3" Temperature Return Setting
"E4" Soft start Setting and
"E5" Changing from Celsius to Fahrenheit
